# Execute shell commands on remote machine(s) from a local script using SSH

This directory lists three different possibilities to execute shell commands on
one or more different machines from a local script via SSH. This way, a script 
can be written that executes shell commands both on a local machine and on one 
or more remote machines (e.g. after unlocking your local private key one time or
inserting your smartcard or hardware token and typing the unlocking PIN for SSH
authentication).
