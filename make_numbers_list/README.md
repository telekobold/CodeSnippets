# Make numbers list

Recently I wanted to inventory the contents of 10 USB sticks which accumulated 
over the last years. For that, I wanted to create a text file "inventory.txt" 
with the following initial content:

```

1:


2:


3:

...

10:


```

While typing this, I thought to myself that this could also be automated with
a few lines of Python code. After finishing this, I felt like implementing this
in a few other programming languages for practice purposes since these are very
basic operations (e.g. writing to a file).
