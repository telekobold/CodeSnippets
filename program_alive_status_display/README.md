# Program Alive Status Display

Sometimes, calculations take a few seconds or even minutes. These two small
scripts show how a simple "I'm still alive" indicator can be implemented 
started in a separate thread either by using another function or another
class. The goal is to prevent the user from nervously typing on the keyboard 
thinking some input should be made or that the program has crashed.
